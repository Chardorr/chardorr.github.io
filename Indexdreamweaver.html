<title>GUISBY Rayon Baby Pajamas</title>	  

<p>Our baby pajamas are made from <i>95% rayon made from bamboo</i> and <i>5% spandex</i> that is super soft and gentle on your babies skin, perfect choice for playtime, naptime or just hanging out.</p>

<p>Our baby sleepers have round neck, snap buttons on the shoulders, long sleeves, and footless design allow baby to move around.</p>

<p>Baby rompers design a snap button at the crotch, conveniently to change the diaper for your baby.Our baby bodysuit is the best choice for <i>novice mothers.</i></p>

<p>I wanted a footless long sleeve sleeper for summer with snaps, which I prefer. The snaps are too far apart but work fine for me as I still use a sleep sack for my baby as well. It is very easy to slip on and off. Weâ€™ll see how the material stands up but so far so good!</p>

<p>We ordered this for a 13 month old. It fits him fine. He is in about the 50th percentile. The cuffs are nice and help it to fit his short little arms. The material is so nice to touch. I've never seen bamboo fabric before but it is amazingly soft. The color is very vibrant and a good match to the listing photo.</p>

<p>Nice soft little PJ that washed well. We sewed some homemade appliques on it to make it into a Superkitties costume and it worked well for that purpose. The legs were a little short. I wouldn't normally buy this style since I prefer zippers over snaps but no complaints.</p>
